    <p>My name is Kelvin Mundi. I come from Nairobi Kenya in East Africa where the sun shines all year long! I relocated to Atlanta in 2013. I graduated from West Georgia Technical College with an Associate's degree in Computer Programming & Computer Support.</p>

    <p>I love art, coding, and creating new things in general. My hobbies include travelling, playing basketball, soccer, and deejaying at parties (for fun üòÅ). I also recently started working out and lifting weights here and there because I had some terrible eating habits.</p>

    <p>I am a firm believer of trying new things; you never really know/learn unless you try it! Fun fact about me: I can't swim. I've just never been interested not that I am hydrophobic, of course! Yeah so don't include me in your cruise vacation plans!</p>
